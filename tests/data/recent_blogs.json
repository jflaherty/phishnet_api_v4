The MJM is pleased to introduce last week&#39;s and three-time MJM winner <a href=\"http://phish.net/user/FunkyCFunkyDo\">@FunkyCFunkyDo</a>, who was so eager to try his hand at clip selection (despite not yet having achieved MJM Emeritus status), that he forewent his winning code from last week to pick this week&#39;s puzzle. Thus, the winner of MJM242 will receive <strong>two</strong> codes good for the MP3 downloads of any <strong>two</strong> shows, courtesy of our friends at <a href=\"http://livephish.com/\">LivePhish.com</a> / <a href=\"http://nugs.net/\">Nugs.Net</a>. To win, be the first person to identify the song and date of each of the <strong>two</strong> mystery jam clips, which are connected by a theme. Each person gets one guess &ndash; if no one guesses correctly, I will post a hint on Tuesday, after which each person gets one more guess before I reveal the correct answer on Wednesday around 10 <small>AM</small> PT / 1 <small>PM</small> ET. Good luck!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Answer: </strong>Congrats to <a href=\"http://phish.net/user/runlikecarini\">@runlikecarini</a>, who saw right through <a href=\"http://phish.net/user/FunkyCFunkyDo\">@FunkyCFunkyDo</a> and his &#39;03 <s>addiction</s> obsession (better word choice) to snag two codes in identifying the pair of Shoreline &#39;03 masterpieces: <a href=\"http://phish.in/2003-07-09/bathtub-gin?t=11m58s\">7/9/03 Bathtub Gin</a>, and <a href=\"http://phish.in/2003-07-10/divided-sky?t=16m20s\">7/10/03 DEGvided Sky</a>. Though we hadn&#39;t yet met, Funky and I both attended these shows in our younger days (he was in high school; I had just graduated college) &ndash; in fact, I was at <a href=\"http://phish.net/user/FunkyCFunkyDo/shows\">Funky&#39;s first four shows</a>, and we&#39;ve been at 20 of the same shows overall (and have met up at nearly every West Coast tour stop since Fall &#39;14). Thanks to Funky for the fun but manageable MJM, and stay tuned on Monday when the MJM keeps it rolling and takes a small step up in difficulty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://bit.ly/11aslY0\"><figure><img alt=\"All-Time MJM Results\" src=\"http://smedia.pnet-static.com/img/mjm_results_2015.png\" /><figcaption>All-Time MJM Results</figcaption></figure></a></p>",

Roaring out of the gates with &ldquo;Ghost,&rdquo; the band offered only the second show-opening Ghost since the &lsquo;90s, the other also being at Dick&rsquo;s (<a href=\"http://phish.net/setlists/?d=2013-08-30&amp;highlight=222\">8/31/13</a>, the &ldquo;MOST SHOWS SPELL SOMETHING&rdquo; gig). Rounding out at a little over ten minutes, it was still too early to sense that this was a night where IT was happening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img  src=\"http://smedia.pnet-static.com/img/herschel_1.png\" /><br />\r\n<small>Photo by Herschel Gelman.</small></p>",

                "teaser": "<p>What follows is the consensus Top Ten shows of 2013 as collectively determined by the phish.net <a href=\"http://phish.net/credits\">working group</a>. But first a word about the process of these rankings. Yes, we have ranked these shows in order from 1-10. But if you don&#39;t like ranking something as subjective as a Phish show then just think of this list as ten <em>really good</em> Phish shows from what proved to be an outstanding year for the band. That&#39;s largely how we think of the list. This composite list reflects precisely none of our individual opinions. Even if it did, I don&#39;t think any of us think a show we personally ranked #6 is indisputably better than our #7 show. And even if <em>that</em> were true, everyone has different things they look for in a show.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What we can tell you is that this list was put together by a bunch of people who really love Phish and anything that&#39;s mentioned below is absolutely worth your time to check out, if you&#39;re not familiar with it. Please note that no fans were harmed in the development of this list; it is entirely for fun and entertainment and should be taken in that light-hearted spirit. If your favorite show of the year doesn&rsquo;t appear in this list, it isn&rsquo;t because we didn&rsquo;t think it was a good show! Your list &ndash; or no list &ndash; is every bit as valid as ours. But as our resident <a href=\"http://phish.net/user/Doctor_Smarty\">National Treasure</a> noted in regard to the <a href=\"http://phish.net/setlists/?d=2013-07-27\">second Gorge gig</a> &ndash; for which he advocated strongly, but ultimately ranked #11 &ndash; &ldquo;we&rsquo;re not handing out participation medals here, this is the Top Ten; you have to respect the science.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So without further ado, &quot;We asked fifteen &uuml;ber Phish Nerds &#39;Name your favorite shows of 2013.&#39; Top Ten answers on the board. Survey says...&quot; [<a href=\"https://twitter.com/lumpblockclod\">SP</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pzerbo\">PZ</a>]</p>",
